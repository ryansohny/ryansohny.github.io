I started working as a postdoctoral researcher at [Stergachis lab in University of Washington](https://stergachislab.org/) beginning in September 2024. Ever since I joined this lab, I've been involved in the project called "Somatic mosaicism across Human Tissues", that is, "SMaHT" which was established to understand mosaic variants in different human genomes and also in different tissues. Particularly our group together with [Eichler lab](https://eichlerlab.gs.washington.edu/) and [Benett lab](https://depts.washington.edu/cdbrm/wordpress/research-labs-center-for-developmental-biology-and-regenerative-medicine/bennett-lab/), is building on the concept of constructing individual-specific genome assemby for each subject ("Donor-Specific Assembly (DSA)) and leveraging that to discover somatic mosaic variants, unable to be detected using the current practice of investigating genomic variants, which mainly uses "haploid" human reference genome[^1]. 

I have realized that I need to revisit the elementary (thus, inevitably core) ideas in the Population and Quantitative Genetics as they form the essence of the work that I've been doing.
