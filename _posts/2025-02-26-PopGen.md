I started working as a postdoctoral researcher in [University of Washington at Andrew Stergachis lab](https://stergachislab.org/) beginning in September 2024. Ever since I joined this lab, I've been involved in the project called "Somatic mosaicism across Human Tissues", that is, "SMaHT" which was established to understand mosaic variants in the human genomes. Particularly our group together with [Eichler lab](https://eichlerlab.gs.washington.edu/) and [Benett lab](https://depts.washington.edu/cdbrm/wordpress/research-labs-center-for-developmental-biology-and-regenerative-medicine/bennett-lab/), is building on the concept of constructing individual-specific genome assembly ("Donor-Specific Assembly (DSA)) and leveraging that for each individual to discover somatic mosaic variants, unable to detect using the current practice of investigating genomic variants, which uses "haploid" human reference genome[^1]. 

I realized that I'm in despearte need to review the elementary (thus, inevitably core) ideas in the Population and Quantitative Genetics.
