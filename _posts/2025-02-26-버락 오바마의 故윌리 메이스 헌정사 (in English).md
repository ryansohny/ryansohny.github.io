지난 달 18일, 메이저리그의 전설 故윌리 메이스가 93세의 나이로 세상을 떠났다. 필자는 메이저리그의 역사에 대해 아는 바가 많이 없지만, 재키 로빈슨, 행크 애런, 그리고 윌리 메이스 등 메이저리그를 대표하는 역사적 인물들에 대한 명성은 익히 들어 알고 있다. 그리고 유색인종들에 대한 차별이 만연했던 시절, 스포츠적인 성취와 하등 관련이 없는 온갖 멸시와 모욕들을 견뎌내며 메이저리그 (그리고 니그로 리그) 역사의 빛나는 챕터를 써내려간 위인들의 맨 앞에 윌리 메이스가 서있다[^1].

한편 미국의 전 대통령 버락 오바마가 San Francisco Giants[^2] 공식 유튜브 계정에 윌리 메이스에 대한 헌정사를 남긴 것이 화제가 되었다. 명불허전한 버락 오바마의 Speech능력을 엿볼 수 있다. 영어를, 또 communication을 공부하는 분들의 입장에서도 참고할 지점이 많다고 생각하여 원문을 받아적어 여기에 소개하였다.

Like many of you, I was too young to see Willie Mays’ play in his prime. And yet it’s a testimony to his greatness, on and off the field, that he served an inspiration to me and to so many other Americans.

Willie’s exploits on the field are well-known and the stuff of legend. Blessed with an unmatched combination of grace, skill and power, he excelled in every aspect of the game from the moment he arrived in the Majors, amassing a record of accomplishments that only a handful of players even came close to matching.

When you take into account his durability and longevity, when you factor in his extraordinary success during his brief stint in the Negro League, and the fact that he lost two years of his prime to military service, a strong argument can be made that he is the greatest baseball player to have ever lived.

But, Wille Mays’ impact on our culture goes far beyond statistics. Afterall in the 50s and 60s, baseball dominated American Sports. Nothing came close. And as one of the Major League’s first black players, Willie’s excellence as well as the sheer beauty of his game, the basket catches, the too small cap that would fly off as he rounded the bases, his daring and his effortless charisma, ended up bridging our nation’s racial divide.

Whether you were black or white, everyone could appreciate Willie’s unbridled enthusiasm, his work ethic, his inherent dignity and graciousness. Alongside other giants, like Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron, Willie’s popularity would change racial attitudes in a way that political speeches alone never could. It made people reexamine how they viewed their fellow citizens and the imperative of true equality and helped pave the way for the Civil Rights Revolution that would move us toward a more perfect union. Not many athletes can claim that kind of impact.

In a very real sense, Willie Mays’ career was one of the foundation stones that would ultimately allow someone like me to even consider running for President of the United States, which is why I consider the opportunity to have gotten to know Wilie over the years and say thank you to him to be one of the great joys of my life.

By the time I met him, Willie’s sight was failing, he didn’t move around too well but I nevertheless had a chance to experience firsthand, the warmth and generosity of the man and how he drew people to him and immediately put them at ease. I’ll never forget giving Willie a ride to the All-star game back in 2009. And let me tell you, as president it was rare for me to be the second most important guy on the Air Force One but with Willie on board, it wasn’t even close. The flight attendants kept passing me by to ask “Can I get you something else Mr. Mays?” And as far as I was concerned, that’s exactly how it should have been.

That’s who Willie Mays was from start to finish, a man who inspired admiration and affection without ever having to break a sweat. That’s why his influence lasted long after he’d played his last game. And that’s why those of us who were lucky enough to know, “The Say Hey Kid, we’ll miss him very very much”

God bless Willie Mays and may he rest in eternal peace.
